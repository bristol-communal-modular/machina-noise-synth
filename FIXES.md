# Rev2 Fixes

Tracking the things that need to be fixed with the rev2 build.

* Resonance pot is reversed
* Resonance pot is only really useful for the first small part. reduce it to 10k?
    Maybe a resistor in parallel as well to give a better response curve?
* Cutoff dual gang needs to be 10k
* Footprint for JFETs is wrong. Has incorrect pinout
* R16 and R25 need to be reduced quite a bit. maybe 100r
    They set the max cutoff frequency.

## Tweaks

Try reducing R24 to get more gain and distortion
Check if C4 is necessary
Check if R15 is necessary
